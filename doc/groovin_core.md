A Delicious Flutter Starter Project created by GroovinChip

## Getting Started 🚀

**❗ In order to start using Groovin Core you must have the [Flutter SDK][flutter_install_link] installed on your machine.**

### Installation 💻

For first time users, start by installing the Groovin CLI from git like so:

```sh
$ dart pub global activate --source git git@github.com:GroovinChip/groovin_cli.git
```

### Create a new Flutter Project 🆕

Then, you can use the `groovin create` command just like you would `flutter create`. For extra funzies you can use the `groovin bake` alias.

### Running the Project ⚡

Once you have finished running `groovin create` with the project directory of your choice, you can change directories into the new project directory and install the dependencies

```sh
$ cd my_app
$ flutter packages get
```

_\*Very Good Core works on iOS and Android, with Web and Desktop support coming soon._

Now your app is running 🎉

## Why Very Good Core? 🤔

This project is built on Very Good Vetures' [very_good_cli](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_cli). I've long been frustrated by having to repeat the same steps over and over in my projects that I finally just forked this project and customized it to my liking.

The CLI to be extensible so it could potentially support multiple commands and templates in the future, just like the `very_good_cli` is.
