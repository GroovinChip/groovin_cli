# Contributing to Groovin CLI

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

This project is built on Very Good Vetures' [very_good_cli](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_cli). I've long been frustrated by having to repeat the same steps over and over in my projects that I finally just forked this project and customized it to my liking. You are welcome to submit bug reports, features requests, pull requests, whatever you can think of. Just remember that this is a very biased project!
